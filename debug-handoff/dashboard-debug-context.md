# Dashboard Blank Screen Debug Context

## Problem Description
After completing file upload and AI analysis, the dashboard page shows completely blank. Analysis appears to complete successfully but dashboard doesn't render.

## Current Analysis Flow
1. User uploads files in Upload.jsx
2. Analysis runs via useAIAnalysis hook
3. Navigation to /dashboard occurs
4. Dashboard.jsx loads but renders blank screen

## Key Files to Check
- `src/pages/Dashboard.jsx` - Main dashboard component
- `src/hooks/useAIAnalysis.js` - Analysis hook managing state
- `src/services/geminiService.js` - AI service with JSON parsing
- Browser console errors and localStorage data

## Analysis Data Structure Expected
```javascript
analysisResults: {
  transcriptData: {
    studentInfo: { name, gpa, totalCredits },
    completedCourses: [{ courseCode, credits, grade, semester }],
    summary: { totalCourses, totalCredits, gpa, lastSemester }
  },
  degreeAuditData: {
    degreeInfo: { degreeName, major, expectedGraduation },
    requirements: {
      majorRequirements: { totalRequired, completed, remaining: [] },
      minorRequirements: { totalRequired, completed, remaining: [] },
      generalEducation: { totalRequired, completed, remaining: [] },
      electives: { totalRequired, completed, remaining, description }
    },
    summary: { totalCreditsRequired, totalCreditsCompleted, totalCreditsRemaining }
  },
  timelineData: {
    scenarios: [{ name, graduationDate, timeline, summary }]
  },
  error: null
}
```

## Debugging Steps Needed
1. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
2. Verify localStorage contains analysis results
3. Test if Dashboard renders with mock data vs real data
4. Add console.log statements to track data flow
5. Check if CSS/styling issues causing invisible content
6. Verify React router navigation working properly

## Known Issues
- JSON parsing errors from AI responses
- Data structure mismatches between expected and actual
- CSS classes not loading (Tailwind issues)
- React state not updating properly after analysis

## Files That Need Debugging
1. **Dashboard.jsx:28-41** - Data mapping logic from analysisResults
2. **useAIAnalysis.js:96-109** - Results storage and state updates  
3. **geminiService.js:77-92** - JSON extraction and parsing
4. Browser DevTools localStorage inspection
5. Network tab for API calls and responses
